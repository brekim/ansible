        With your quadrant selected, you can choose one of two chat features.

        <li>Matched Chat - Queues you with a person from another quadrant</li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        During a conversation, we have several features to streamline
        conversations.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Icebreaker - You can either begin a conversation with a topic you’d
          like to discuss or click the Icebreaker button to suggest a random
          topic. This helps more introverted individuals get engaged earlier.
        </li>
        <li>
          Report - If you are being harassed, you can report people for toxic
          behavior. The conversation will end and the discussion will be
          manually reviewed. This ensures more positive and constructive
          experiences for users, creating a community of appreciation.
        </li>
        <li>
          One-Sided End - You can force a one-sided end if you feel like exiting
          the conversation due to connections, other commitments,
          uncomfortability, but had a civil discussion with the other person.
          It’ll give you the option to write a friendly message before you go.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mutual End - When the discussion comes to a natural end, both users
          can propose and accept a Mutual End to the conversation. Mutual ends
          boost the Kudos of both members, which is a measure of a user’s
          civility on the app.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Members with positive Kudos contributions over a span of time will be
        promoted to moderators.
      </li>
    </ol>
